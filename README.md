Module 6 Challenge

For Weatherpy, I looked up on StackOverflow on how to input a timestamp so that it'll automatically update the date whenever the code is run. I also looked up documentation and asked "Xpert Learning Assistant" for help on forming the define function to create Linear Regression plots.  I wanted to make sure the syntax was correct in writing the function code. I also looked up the Matplotlib documentation on plt.annotate and text_coordinates so I could change the location of the linear regression line equation with each graph.

For VacationPy, I looked up where to find hotel information on the GeoAPify website. I also looked up on StackOverflow how to add hover columns to include the hotel name and country when hovering over the hvplot map.
